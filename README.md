The website created is intended to serve as a marketplace where users can create, buy, and sell nfts. It includes 3 stores of data in firebase - one for each NFT, one for users, and one to track the transactions that take place (buying and selling). Users have the ability to enter a url, name, and description and add nfts to their collection.
